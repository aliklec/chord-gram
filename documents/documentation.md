# Use Cases

DRAFT

Takes as user input *n* number of chords (possibly to be selected from dropdown?).

As output, user will get a sequence of the *n* most likely chords to follow.

Other possible outputs:
-option to play audio for the full chord sequence that was generated (using Tone.js or HTML <audio>?)
-option to display the notes that make up the chords
-A "generate" button that will start generating likely chord sequences (without the user having to input specific ones)
